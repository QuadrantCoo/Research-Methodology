\noindent \textbf{DETERMINING THE ROAD USAGE BEHAVIOR OF MAKERERE HILL ROAD IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THE INEFFICIENCY AND REDUNDANCY OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS SYSTEM} \\

\noindent 

\noindent Over recent years, Makerere Hill Road has been a confusion center to both traffic and pedestrians in as far as the ways to share its complex conjunctions. With the recent repair of the raid and establishment of a traffic lights system to control the traffic, order and sanity has been restored to this road however, we believe that this traffic lights system can do better and be more efficient. That is to say, consider variations in traffic over time and at specific times, consider road usage events at specific times such as school children needing to cross the road and changing road flow to lines that have no traffic leading to time wastage. With adequate research, a standing solution can be achieved. \\

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{MAIN OBJECTIVE}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ }To find out how traffic flow changes over time.

\item  To determine the intervals for change of each traffic flow to another.

\item  To estimated the usage frequency of each road line over time by number of cars over time.

\item  To examine the intensity of pedestrians crossing.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent 

\noindent \textbf{SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{ }To establish new traffic light control algorithms for better interval changes and flows.

\item  To determine and avoid road usage redundancies. (Transferring traffic flow for lines with no traffic.)

\item  To specify new pedestrian crossing sessions and intervals which favor their crossing need.
\end{enumerate}
